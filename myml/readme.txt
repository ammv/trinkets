this is where I started learning about machine learning. I immediately had an idea. Based on K nearest neighbors and 50 training images. It didn't work out very well. I wanted the program to distinguish between Russian bills and tell me which picture shows which bill. It didn't work very well, but it worked and sometimes gave the right answers. For images, it is better not to use this algorithm.
