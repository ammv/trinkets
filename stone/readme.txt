here the two programs happened to be together. Socket chat I think it is clear what it is. Stones is a game, there are N-stones, there are two opponents, each in turn can take 1,3,4 stones. Who will take the last stones or the stone won. Here the program generates all possible outcomes and the right strategies for winning, depending on who started the move. I do not recommend using more than 12 stones, as the game starts to calculate a lot for a very long time and it can be busy.
